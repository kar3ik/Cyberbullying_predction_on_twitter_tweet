##cyber bullying predictive analysis on twitter data 


The cyberbullying detection framework is comprised of two primary components
- The first portion is known as NLP (Natural Language Processing), 
- while the second half is known as ML (Machine Learning) (Machine learning)

The first module collects datasets comprising bullying texts, messages, or posts and prepares them for machine learning techniques utilising natural language processing.
The analyzed datasets are then used to train machine learning algorithms to detect harassing or bullying messages on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
To identify remarks as bullying or non-bullying, we employed two machine learning algorithms: Adaboost, gradient boosting, Sklearn and Maxnet
